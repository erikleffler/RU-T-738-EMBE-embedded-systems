Problem 1

The memory when using simba is:

	RAM:   [===       ]  26.1% (used 535 bytes from 2048 bytes)
	Flash: [===       ]  27.5% (used 8878 bytes from 32256 bytes)

Problem 2

2.1:
As the main function exits, so does the operating system

2.2:
The schedueler never initiates a context switch to the pin task. The main task is left to execute forever.

2.3:
The main task never goes from executing to waiting.

2.4:
when sleep is called, the main task blocks, leaving cpu time for the led task.

The operating system must be cooperative. The main task itself has to initiate a blocking statement, signaling the operating system for a context switch.
